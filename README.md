# eCarBookingWebApp
Web application car booking system, group project. The client, Edinburgh College, requested a system that would allow their employees to book their electric vehicles. The system should allow employees to make a booking, when the car is not in use, between other bookings. The booking system should also replace all paper forms related to the process and facilitate their online completion.

A combination of PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL and Bootstrap was used to develop the project.  

Skills practiced during the project:

<br>• Team working</br>
<br>• Analysing customer request</br>
<br>• Negotiating skills</br>
<br>• Problem solving</br>
<br>• Finding solutions with limited time and resources</br>
<br>• Design, development and testing.</br>

The team managed to create a prototype which met all of the client's demands. The web application contains:
<br>• Registration</br>
<br>• User dashboard</br>
<br>• Change password feature</br>
<br>• Booking history</br>
<br>• Log and check sheets</br>
<br>• Calendar and checkout page</br>


The team had limited time and resources. Further development would benefit from the introduction of the OOP concept, especially in relation to the booking calendar, which currently is 'hard coded' in SQL. The application would greatly benefit from MVC architecture, through creation of classes and methods.
